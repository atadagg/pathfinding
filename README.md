This is my shot at writing a pathfinding algorithm.

Main Goal:
Find middle of the maze

The constraints of this program were:
1. Robot doesn't know which direction it's looking
2. Robot doesn't know where it is at on the maze.
3. Robot doesn't know how big the maze is.
4. Robot can only turn left
5. Robot can only have one function to move called trystep which checks if the robot can move forward or not and if it can moves it.


### Main Algorithm: Wall Follower Algorithm

The robot basically sticks to a wall and follows it.

That's it.

I've used tkinter(which was quite the challenge) to visualize the maze.
